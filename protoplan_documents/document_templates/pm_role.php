<h1>Context</h1>
The Project Manager is the individual ultimately responsible for the project and is supported by the Senior Supplier and the Senior User.  The Executives role is to lead the Board in the meeting of the project’s objectives and benefits as shown in the Business Case, for which they are responsible.  Key is balancing the varying demands of the business, supplier and user but the Project Board isn’t a democracy.  The Executive should look for inputs and support from the Senior User and Senior Supplier but it is they who are the ultimate decision maker.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
These are in addition to the collective responsibilities of the Project Board:
  <li>	Select the project management team (in particular the Project manager)</li>
 <li>	Oversee the development of the Project Brief and Business Case, including ensuring this is aligned with any relevant corporate strategies (if required also managing the approval of this with programme or corporate management)</li>
  <li>	Ensure that sufficient funding is available and secured for the project</li>
  <li>	Approval of any additional supplier contracts that may be required (if the relationship is a commercial one)</li>
  <li>	Holding the Senior Supplier to account for the specialist approach and products produced for the project both in terms of quality and integrity</li>
  <li>	Holding the Senior User to account for obtaining the predicted benefits of the project.  Ensuring these are realized and that the reviews take place to monitor the degree to which the benefits stated in the Business Case are achieved.</li>
  <li>	Ensuring the responsibility for post project benefits reviews is transferred to programme or corporate management</li>
  <li>	Regular review of the business case and monitoring and control of progress in strategic terms as well as making sure that risks associated with the business case are identified and managed appropriately</li>
  <li>	If project tolerance is forecast to be exceeded the Executive must escalate issues and risks to programme or corporate management.</li>
  <li>	Be decisive on escalated issues keeping the focus on a continued business justification</li>
  <li>	Organise and chair appropriate Project Board reviews</li>
  <li>	Make arrangements for appropriate business assurance of the project i.e. that the business case remains valid and that the project will be completed within tolerances.  In some circumstances the Executive may choose to delegate some of the assurance activities (if so these should be documented in the separate project Assurance role).</li>
