PRINCE2® recommends the following actions:

    Review the project mandate and check understanding
    Appoint the Executive (the appointment is made by the commissioning organization - typically corporate or programme management):
        Establish the responsibilities for the Executive
        Prepare the role description for the Executive based on the role description in the folder ‘Roles and responsibilities’ as part of the product package
        Estimate the time and effort required for the Executive role (this will be refined later)
        Identify candidates for the Executive from the project’s stakeholders and select the most appropriate person for the role
        Confirm the selected person’s availability, their acceptance of the role, and their commitment to carry it out
        Assign the selected person to the role of Executive




<h1>Context(Role)</h1>
The Executive is the individual ultimately responsible for the project and is supported by the Senior Supplier and the Senior User.  The Executives role is to lead the Board in the meeting of the project’s objectives and benefits as shown in the Business Case, for which they are responsible.  Key is balancing the varying demands of the business, supplier and user but the Project Board isn’t a democracy.  The Executive should look for inputs and support from the Senior User and Senior Supplier but it is they who are the ultimate decision maker.




<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
These are in addition to the collective responsibilities of the Project Board:
•	Select the project management team (in particular the Project manager)
•	Oversee the development of the Project Brief and Business Case, including ensuring this is aligned with any relevant corporate strategies (if required also managing the approval of this with programme or corporate management)
•	Ensure that sufficient funding is available and secured for the project
•	Approval of any additional supplier contracts that may be required (if the relationship is a commercial one)
•	Holding the Senior Supplier to account for the specialist approach and products produced for the project both in terms of quality and integrity
•	Holding the Senior User to account for obtaining the predicted benefits of the project.  Ensuring these are realized and that the reviews take place to monitor the degree to which the benefits stated in the Business Case are achieved.
•	Ensuring the responsibility for post project benefits reviews is transferred to programme or corporate management
•	Regular review of the business case and monitoring and control of progress in strategic terms as well as making sure that risks associated with the business case are identified and managed appropriately
•	If project tolerance is forecast to be exceeded the Executive must escalate issues and risks to programme or corporate management.
•	Be decisive on escalated issues keeping the focus on a continued business justification
•	Organise and chair appropriate Project Board reviews
•	Make arrangements for appropriate business assurance of the project i.e. that the business case remains valid and that the project will be completed within tolerances.  In some circumstances the Executive may choose to delegate some of the assurance activities (if so these should be documented in the separate project Assurance role).
